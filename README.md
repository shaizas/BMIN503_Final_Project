### Overview
TITLE: Philadelphia City Landscape Assessment of Social-Demographic Characteristics for Receiving Adequate Prenatal Care in Migrant Populations 2020

ABSTRACT: This project obtained data from the Center for Disease (CDC) WONDER Database 2016-2020 (expanded version), which follows an ad-hoc query system for *the analysis of public health data.* Using a multiple logistic regression model, the study aimed to identify the relationship between select demographic characteristics and receiving adequate prenatal care services for migrant populations in Philadelphia. *VALUE NEEDED HERE(n=164). 

TEAM DETAILS: This project was extensively discussed with the data team with the City of Philadelphia, Department of Public Health (PDPH) within the Maternal, Child, and Family Health Division (MCFH). Members of the data team, MP and AM, have been initialized for the team's privacy. (Names can be found in the discussion comments of the Canvas Submission). The team consisted of a quantitative data analyst specialist (MP) MPH, CPH and the City's chief medical officer MD, MPP. 

1. MH MPH, CPH was involved in assisting the development of the statistical approach. Meetings involved discussion of the best statistical process for the data set. MH recommended using multiple logistic regression and determining if prenatal services have been provided adequately through a dichotomous approach (Y/N to receiving adequate prenatal care) to simplify data interpretation. 
1. AM MD, MPP acted in a supervisory role as chief medical officer to guide the selection of social factors for assessment and identify the project's social impact. There is currently very little understanding of migrant research and their respective health outcomes in Philadelphia.

The coding material is intended to be used with a different dataset to utilize the findings to identify potential social barriers. The information from this project will ideally be a part of a larger strategy proposal acting as a City Landscape Assessment for developing a healthcare service delivery model for prenatal care for migrant and undocumented immigrants.

### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its, and some background to motivate the problem. Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Comprehensive prenatal care has been shown to lead to improved health outcomes for both mothers and newborns.1 If sought early in a birthing person’s pregnancy, antenatal care can be used as an effective preventative measure for adverse health outcomes, such as severe maternal morbidity and low neonatal birth weight.2,3 Services are typically established within the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy, following twelve to fifteen visits in total after the initial visit.4 The current model practiced within the United Citys recommends that patients visit monthly until twenty-eight weeks, bi-weekly until thirty-two weeks, and weekly until delivery.4 Visits are critical to promoting a safe delivery by effectively monitoring the patient's progress and development of the fetus. Healthcare providers are responsible for providing supportive care through medical screenings, lab testing for birth anomalies, image testing, and education (parenting, pregnancy materials, infant feeding).2 Services often include psychosocial support to address substance use, resources for domestic violence, mental health services, avenues for financial aid, and nutritional needs.4

The City of Philadelphia has a highly urban landscape, with individuals belonging to diverse social and cultural backgrounds that may hinder access to quality prenatal care. In 2020, only 52% of birthing persons sought care within the first trimester in Philadelphia, which is comparatively much lower than the national average of 77%.5,6 The Philadelphia Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC) found that 32% of all pregnancy-associated deaths occurred in birthing persons who didn’t opt in for prenatal care or were too late (third trimester).6  Of these deaths, 69% of individuals, had multiple co-morbidities that would have been screened and identified appropriately had the patient attended regular prenatal visits.6 Overall, more than half of all pregnancy-related deaths that occurred in Philadelphia were deemed preventable.6 These statistics capture the challenges and elucidate potential barriers patients may face to receiving adequate maternal and child care in Philadelphia.  Common barriers include financial constraints, transportation access, lifestyle limitations (childcare, paid time off from work), and overall distrust of the medical field stemming from perceived discrimination and cultural practice.7 Social indicators such as race, age, education levels, socio-economic status have been shown to have associations with receiving adequate prenatal care among migrant populations.  

Identifying currently underserved populations receiving inadequate access to prenatal services is critical for equitably promoting better maternal and child outcomes. However, there is very limited research in identifying potential social barriers migrant populations face in Philadelphia.

**This project aims to determine the relationship between maternal demographic characteristics for for migrant birthing persons receiving adequate prenatal care services using a multiple logistic regression model.**  *This project specifically will assess the social indicators of race, age, and education level, with receiving adequate prenatal care (Y/N: 10 visits made during pregnancy) in migrant populations*

Evaluations will require an intersectional approach for analysis. Biomedical informatics can be an effective tool for statistical analysis to identify the gravity of public health issues. The results can be helpful to many stakeholders within the maternal and child health sector, from community organizations to large-scale hospital systems. An improved understanding of prenatal care adequacy is critical for identifying barriers to eliminating current issues through robust program implementation.
