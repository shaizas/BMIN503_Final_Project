### Overview
>TITLE: Philadelphia City Landscape Assessment of Social-Demographic Characteristics for Receiving Adequate Prenatal Care in Migrant Populations 2020

ABSTRACT: This project obtained data from the Center for Disease (CDC) WONDER Database 2016-2020 (expanded version), which follows an ad-hoc query system for *the analysis of public health data.* Using a multiple logistic regression model, the study aimed to identify the relationship between select demographic characteristics and receiving adequate prenatal care services for migrant populations in Philadelphia. *VALUE NEEDED HERE(n=164). 

TEAM DETAILS: This project was extensively discussed with the data team with the City of Philadelphia, Department of Public Health (PDPH) within the Maternal, Child, and Family Health Division (MCFH). Members of the data team, MP and AM, have been initialized for the team's privacy. (Names can be found in the discussion comments of the Canvas Submission). The team consisted of a quantitative data analyst specialist (MP) MPH, CPH and the City's chief medical officer MD, MPP. 

1. MH MPH, CPH was involved in assisting the development of the statistical approach. Meetings involved discussion of the best statistical process for the data set. MH recommended using multiple logistic regression and determining if prenatal services have been provided adequately through a dichotomous approach (Y/N to receiving adequate prenatal care) to simplify data interpretation. 
1. AM MD, MPP acted in a supervisory role as chief medical officer to guide the selection of social factors for assessment and identify the project's social impact. There is currently very little understanding of migrant research and their respective health outcomes in Philadelphia.

The coding material is intended to be used with a different dataset to utilize the findings to identify potential social barriers. The information from this project will ideally be a part of a larger strategy proposal acting as a City Landscape Assessment for developing a healthcare service delivery model for prenatal care for migrant and undocumented immigrants.
